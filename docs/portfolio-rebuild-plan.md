# Portfolio Site Rebuild Plan

## Overview

A modern headless portfolio site with a Vue 3 SPA frontend consuming a lightweight Slim 4 PHP API. Content is managed via flat YAML/Markdown files outside the repository, synced locally and to the server via rsync. The public GitHub repo demonstrates the full stack while keeping content separate and privately managed.

## Goals

- Demonstrate Vue 3, TypeScript, Vite, and modern frontend architecture
- Show clean API design via Slim 4
- Maintain the existing cyberpunk art-deco aesthetic with improved UX
- Make content easy to add and update without touching code
- Surface portfolio work and articles effectively from the homepage
- Provide a public code repo employers can browse

---

## Stack

### Frontend

- **Vue 3** with Composition API
- **TypeScript**
- **Vite** for build tooling
- **Vue Router** for SPA client-side routing
- **marked.js** for client-side Markdown rendering
- **js-yaml** for any client-side YAML parsing if needed

### Backend

- **Slim 4** PHP micro-framework
- **symfony/yaml** for YAML parsing
- Flat-file content layer — no database

### Content Layer (outside repo)

- YAML files for structured content (portfolio items, job history, skills)
- Markdown files for long-form prose (article bodies)
- YAML manifests for ordering and listing content

## Content File Formats

### Manifest (e.g. `manifests/portfolio.yaml`)

```yaml
items:
  - lighthouse
  - ga4-intelligence
  - lwb
  - pihole-dashboard
```

Just an ordered list of slugs. Reorder to change display order. Add a slug to include a new item.

### Portfolio Item (e.g. `portfolio/lighthouse.yaml`)

```yaml
title: Lighthouse
slug: lighthouse
date_start: 2007
date_end: present
featured: true
external_url: ~
technologies:
  - laravel
  - php
  - vuejs
  - mysql
  - rest-apis
  - responsive-design
summary: |
  Short summary shown in list view.
body: |
  Full markdown content shown on detail view.

  ## What is this?

  Lighthouse is the internal custom project management tool...
gallery:
  - filename: lighthouse-dashboard.png
    alt: Lighthouse dashboard view
```

### Article (e.g. `articles/ai-tooling-strategy.md`)

```markdown
---
title: Problem-First AI Strategy
slug: ai-tooling-strategy
date: 2026-04-15
featured: true
summary: Why the question "how can we use AI?" is the wrong starting point, and what to ask instead.
tags:
  - ai
  - strategy
  - development
---

Full article content in markdown...
```

### Page Layout Config (e.g. `config/pages/home.yaml`, checked in)

```yaml
sections:
  - type: hero
    content: home-hero        # references a content key or inline
  - type: featured-portfolio
    manifest: portfolio
    limit: 3
    filter: featured
  - type: featured-articles
    manifest: articles
    limit: 3
    filter: featured
  - type: skills
    source: skills
```

---

## API Endpoints

All responses are `application/json`. Markdown is returned as raw strings for client-side rendering.

```text
GET /api/page/{page}
  Returns page layout config for the given page slug.
  Used by views to know what sections to render and in what order.

GET /api/manifest/{name}?limit=3&filter=featured
  Returns ordered list of content items from a manifest.
  Resolves slugs to full content objects.
  Supports optional limit and filter params.

GET /api/content/{type}/{slug}
  Returns a single content item by type and slug.
  Types: portfolio, article, job
```

### Example Response — `GET /api/manifest/portfolio?limit=3&filter=featured`

```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "slug": "lighthouse",
      "title": "Lighthouse",
      "date_start": 2007,
      "date_end": "present",
      "featured": true,
      "summary": "Short summary...",
      "technologies": ["laravel", "php", "vuejs"]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Vue Router Routes

Top-level routes render into the default `<RouterView>`. Second-level (detail) routes use named views — the parent listing renders in the `default` view (visible behind the modal), and the item renders in the `modal` view.

```typescript
// Top-level — full page transitions
/                    → { default: HomeView }
/portfolio           → { default: PortfolioView }
/articles            → { default: ArticlesView }
/job-history         → { default: JobHistoryView }

// Second-level — modal overlay, parent stays visible behind
/portfolio/:slug     → { default: PortfolioView, modal: PortfolioItemView }
/articles/:slug      → { default: ArticlesView,  modal: ArticleView       }
```

`meta.modal: true` flags modal routes so `App.vue` knows to render the overlay.

---

## Navigation Architecture & Transitions

### Top-level page transitions

The default `<RouterView>` in `App.vue` is wrapped in Vue's `<Transition>` component. Each top-level route carries a `meta.transition` value; a watcher sets the active transition name dynamically so direction (forward/back) can vary the animation.

**Effect:** The current page's content container drops forward and fades out (`translateY` + slight `rotateX` + `opacity → 0`). The incoming page flips up from below and fades in (reverse). Achieved with CSS `perspective` + 3D transforms on the `ContentCard` wrapper — not the full viewport.

Key CSS properties: `perspective`, `transform-style: preserve-3d`, `rotateX`, `translateY`, `opacity`, `transition`.

### Modal / overlay routing (second-level)

`App.vue` has two `<RouterView>` elements:

```html
<RouterView />               <!-- main content, always present -->
<RouterView name="modal" />  <!-- modal overlay, active on modal routes only -->
```

The `modal` RouterView is wrapped in a `<Transition>` (fade + scale or slide-up) and rendered inside a `ModalOverlay.vue` wrapper that provides:

- Full-viewport backdrop (semi-transparent dark)
- Scroll lock on the background content
- Close button → `router.back()` (or `router.push(parentPath)` if navigated to directly)
- Keyboard `Escape` to close

When navigating directly to a second-level URL (e.g. bookmarked `/portfolio/lighthouse`), the parent listing is still shown in the default view because the route definition includes `PortfolioView` as the `default` component — there's no special handling needed for direct access.

### New components required

- `ModalOverlay.vue` — `src/components/layout/ModalOverlay.vue`
  Backdrop + close affordance. Wraps the modal `<RouterView>`. Watches `route.meta.modal` to show/hide.

- `ContentCard.vue` — `src/components/ui/ContentCard.vue`
  The decorated container (double border + corner brackets). The 3D page transition is applied to this element, so it must exist before transitions are wired up.

### Known trade-offs to revisit

- The `default` view re-renders `PortfolioView` every time `/portfolio/:slug` is navigated to. Component caching with `<KeepAlive>` on the default RouterView may be desirable once the API is wired up, to avoid re-fetching the listing on every modal open/close.
- Transition direction (forward vs back) requires tracking navigation history or comparing route depths — simplest initial approach is a single transition style for all top-level moves, with directional variants added later.

## TypeScript Interfaces

```typescript
// types/portfolio.ts
export interface PortfolioItem {
  slug: string
  title: string
  date_start: number | string
  date_end: number | string
  featured: boolean
  external_url?: string
  technologies: string[]
  summary: string
  body?: string          // only present on detail fetch
  gallery?: GalleryImage[]
}

export interface GalleryImage {
  filename: string
  alt: string
}

// types/article.ts
export interface Article {
  slug: string
  title: string
  date: string
  featured: boolean
  summary: string
  body?: string          // only present on detail fetch
  tags: string[]
}

// types/job.ts
export interface Job {
  slug: string
  title: string
  company: string
  location: string
  date_start: string
  date_end: string
  body: string
}
```

---

## Content Workflow

### Local Development

```bash
# Start Slim API dev server
cd api && php -S localhost:8080 public/index.php

# Start Vue dev server
cd frontend && npm run dev

# Content lives at ~/content/peter-epp/ locally
# API config points to this path via environment variable
```

### Publishing Content

```bash
# Sync content to server (one command)
rsync -avz --delete ~/content/peter-epp/ user@server:/var/content/peter-epp/
```

### Deploying Code

```bash
# On server via webhook or manually
git pull origin main
cd frontend && npm run build   # or CI handles this
```

Code and content deployments are fully independent.

---

## Environment Configuration

```ini
# api/.env (not in repo)
CONTENT_PATH=/var/content/peter-epp
APP_ENV=production
```

```ini
# api/.env.local (not in repo, local dev)
CONTENT_PATH=/home/peter/content/peter-epp
APP_ENV=development
```

---

## Homepage Strategy

The current homepage undersells everything. The rebuilt homepage should:

- **Hero section** — brief, punchy intro. Who you are, what you do, what makes you interesting right now (AI tooling angle front and centre). Not a wall of text.
- **Featured work** — 3 portfolio cards pulled from manifest with `featured: true`, enough to intrigue, linking to full portfolio
- **Featured articles** — 2-3 article cards, showing you have opinions and write about them
- **Skills** — keep the icon-based approach from the current site, but updated to reflect current stack including AI/LLM tooling

---

## New Content to Add

### Portfolio Items to Write Up

- GA4 Analytics Intelligence SPA (Alpine.js + PHP/Slim + Anthropic API)
- Server Notification Triage Tool (Google Apps Script + Claude API)
- Pi-hole Intelligence Dashboard (Python, Docker, QNAP)
- Drupal AI Chatbot Prototype
- Job Listing Aggregator (Alpine.js + Slim + Eloquent + Adzuna API)
- Update Lighthouse entry (current screenshots and features are outdated)

### Skills to Add

- AI/LLM tooling (Anthropic API, Claude Code)
- Alpine.js
- Python
- Docker
- Tailscale / self-hosting / server administration depth
- Cloudflare

### Articles Pipeline

- Problem-first AI strategy (vs tool-first)
- Building an agentic analytics tool — what the loop actually looks like
- Why "AI makes you 10x faster" is the wrong frame
- What vibe-coding without fundamentals actually costs you

## The Clippy Feature

### Concept

A resurrected Clippy companion that appears on page load and navigation, delivers a contextually relevant quip or pointer, and offers a small set of canned navigation buttons. **No open chat input.** This is faithful to classic Clippy behaviour - not genuinely useful, occasionally charming, easily dismissed. Visitors who hate it can ignore it. Visitors who love it will remember the site.

The Anthropic API can be used to generate Clippy's contextual comment based on the current page and its content - streamed into his speech bubble for full effect - but users never type anything to him. He talks at you, not with you.

### Behaviour

- Appears on initial page load and optionally on route change
- Delivers a short, contextually aware comment based on the current page
- Offers 2-4 canned button responses (navigation links, dismiss, maybe a "tell me more" that triggers a second scripted comment)
- Has idle animations when not speaking, per the classic behaviour
- Can be dismissed and stays dismissed for the session (localStorage flag)
- Self-aware and slightly dry in tone - fits the site's personality

### Example Interactions

- **Homepage:** "It looks like you're visiting Peter's portfolio. Would you like to see his work?" → [Show me] [I'll look around]
- **Portfolio:** "It looks like you're browsing projects. Peter has done some interesting AI tooling work recently." → [Show me those] [Back to home]
- **Articles:** "It looks like you're looking for something to read. Peter has opinions about AI. Brace yourself." → [Let's see] [Maybe later]
- **Job History:** "It looks like you're checking if Peter is employable. He is." → [Back to portfolio] [Contact him]

### Implementation Notes

> **Needs further investigation before building** - evaluate the libraries below and confirm which is best maintained and most Vue 3 friendly before committing.

**Recommended starting point:** `clippyjs` by pithings (`github.com/pithings/clippy`) - a modern rewrite with the full animation set, Web Speech API TTS, and a `speakStream()` method that accepts an async iterable, making it purpose-built for streaming LLM output into the speech bubble.

**Alternative:** `modern-clippy` (`github.com/vchaindz/modern-clippy`) - TypeScript-native, dependency-free, simpler API. Worth evaluating if clippyjs has integration friction with Vue 3.

**Things to investigate:**

- Vue 3 integration story for both libraries (wrapping in a composable or component)
- Whether clippyjs assets need self-hosting or pull from a CDN
- Animation set available and whether idle animations are configurable
- Whether the speech bubble styling can be themed to fit the cyberpunk art-deco aesthetic without too much pain
- Anthropic API streaming via `speakStream()` in practice

### Vue Component Shape

```text
src/components/
  clippy/
    ClippyCompanion.vue    # Main wrapper, handles show/hide/session state
    ClippyMessage.vue      # Speech bubble with action buttons
```

The companion component watches the current route, calls the Anthropic API with page context, and streams the response into Clippy's speech bubble via `speakStream()`. Button options are defined per-route in a config object, not generated by the API.

## Claude Code Migration Notes

When using Claude Code to port the existing theme:

- Point it at the live site or the Drupal theme directory to extract CSS custom properties, colour palette, typography, and the art-deco geometric background pattern
- The corner bracket decorative elements on cards should be recreated as Vue components or CSS pseudo-elements
- Font choices and the gold/cyan/dark colour scheme should be extracted as CSS custom properties in a global theme file
- The tech icon badge pattern should become a reusable `TechBadge.vue` component accepting a technology slug and resolving to the correct icon and label
- Preserve the monospace feel of the typography while modernising the overall layout weights and spacing
